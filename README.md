# Time series
> When you try to implement a new technology it'll be necesary to make a research to find out if would be functional or not. You might need some tools from statistics and probability to predict possible states from a chaotic system.
In this time, will be analysed the temperature respect the time.
 ## The issue
>April and May use to be the warmest and driest months of the year so it requires to make a compilation of the temperature and humidity on a room to figure out if it'll be useful to implement a system which can make the room change the temperature & humidity conditions for the people's comodity who's living there or will stay for a long time in a specific room or closed space.
## Getting the data.
>To obtain the data, it will use a circuit to make continue measures of the temperature and humidity with an Arduino Uno, a sensor DHT-11, a reader CARD-SD and a LCD to display the data when it'll not be used on an environment which allows to print the data obtained by the sensor.
>Here it is the diagram

>[!IMPORTANT]
>To understand the code to make the sensor, there is the folder "dataset" and the file with the extension .ino to check out the code, and at the same,would it be an image showing the pinout of the circuit and at the same, the diagram:
But, if you want to understand how it works each module or sensor, it'll be linked other repos that it can be read and have comment explaining the steps or the lies of code:

### Dataset
>The Dataset has been generated by the Arduino's circuit that creates a csv which has the next data

>-Index

>-Temperature

>-Humidity

>-Date

>[!NOTE]
>this csv can be manipulated at the way that it can fix at your needs or at least as practical dataset to study statistics or probability as the same time, any branch related with them.
## Data Analysis.

>[!WARNING]
>At this point it'll be written the way that it has been studied......(METHODOLOGY IN R)
